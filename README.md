In this project, i have implemented new features in java 8.

There are following three most important new features intriduced in java 8 :- 
1. Functional Programming
2. Lambda Expression
3. Stream API


There are few others like Functional interfaces (An interface that contains only one abstract method is known as a functional interface, but there is no restriction, you can have n number of default and static methods inside a
functional interface), Date time API (In Java 8, the Date and Time API, also known as the “java. time” package, was introduced to address the shortcomings  of the older “java.util.Date” and “java.util.Calendar” classes.
The new Date and Time API provides a more comprehensive and flexible way to work with dates, times, and time zones.), Optional Class (In Java 8, the concept of optional classes was introduced as part of the java. util package 
help to handle situations where there is a possibility of getting the NPE.)
